# React weather app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Note

The weather API does not work on browsers that dont allow insecure HTTP connections.\

To circumvent that, on Google Chrome, under settings, under site settings, under additional content settings, click insecure content
Then under allow, add [https://mmmmaximus.github.io](https://mmmmaximus.github.io)
This will allow calls to the weather API via HTTP
